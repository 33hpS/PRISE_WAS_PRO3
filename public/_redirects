# Cloudflare Pages SPA fallback
# Static assets are served as-is. Everything else falls back to index.html.

# Fallback all routes to index.html (200)
# Cloudflare will prefer existing files (JS/CSS/images) automatically.
# Docs: https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/configuration/redirects/
# This avoids returning HTML for existing assets and fixes MIME issues.
# 
# Example:
#   /app/products/123  -> /index.html 200
#   /main.js           -> served as /main.js (if exists)
#   /main.css          -> served as /main.css (if exists)
#
/*    /index.html   200
